          <h2>Founder of Ramakrishna Mission</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family of Calcutta</b
            >, Vivekananda was inclined towards spirituality. He was influenced
            by his guru, Ramakrishna, from whom he learnt that all living beings
            were an embodiment of the divine self; therefore, service to God
            could be rendered by service to humankind. After Ramakrishna's
            death, Vivekananda toured the Indian subcontinent extensively and
            acquired first-hand knowledge of the conditions prevailing in
            British India. He later traveled to the United States, representing
            India at the 1893 Parliament of the World's Religions. Vivekananda
            conducted hundreds of public and private lectures and classes,
            disseminating tenets of Hindu philosophy in the United States,
            England and Europe. In India, Vivekananda is regarded as a patriotic
            saint, and his birthday is celebrated as National Youth Day
